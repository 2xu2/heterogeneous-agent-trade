\begin{frame}[t]{This paper\ldots}
\textbf{1.} Measure tariff-induced changes in consumption (and labor market outcomes) at a narrow geographic level.\\
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item How? I proxy consumption with the universe of new auto sales in the US at monthly frequency, county level. And correlate it with policy actions in the US-China Trade War.
\smallskip
\item Clear evidence that Chinese retaliation had an impact. Both auto sales and employment $\searrow$ in high-tariff counties relative to low-tariff counties.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\bigskip
\textbf{2.} Use a heterogenous agent + multi-region, multi-country trade model to interpret \textbf{1.} and measure the welfare effects.
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item How? Simulate and solve the model's dynamic response to tariff shocks and news about them.
\smallskip
\item Still work in progress. Today|numerical examples and demonstrate ``proof of concept.''
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{What I am \textcolor{red}{NOT} doing vs. What I am doing}
\textcolor{red}{NOT} an evauation/quantification of the ``standard model'' in the trade literature\ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{trade} \Rightarrow \mbox{prices of goods / variety} \Rightarrow \mbox{consumption} \Rightarrow \mbox{welfare}
\end{eqnarray*}\\
\medskip
e.g, how US tariffs on Chinese goods lowered imports and increased prices, {\footnotesize \citet*{fajgelbaum2019return}, \citet*{amiti2019impact}, \citet*{neiman_NBERw26396}}.\\
\bigskip
\bigskip
My paper is about a conceptually important, but less understood mechanism\ldots
\begin{eqnarray*}
\mbox{trade} \Rightarrow \mbox{labor market outcomes} \Rightarrow \mbox{consumption } \Rightarrow \mbox{welfare}
\end{eqnarray*}\\
\medskip
i.e., ``trade as a labor demand shock.''
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item We know something about the first arrow (e.g., {\footnotesize\citet*{david2013china}}).
\smallskip
\item We know nothing about the second arrow | this is my contribution.
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}[t]{Tariff Data and County Exposure}
US tariff data from USTR and Federal Registrar. Chinese tariffs from \citet*{bown_jung_2019}.
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item At HS10 level and then mapped into three-digit NAICS.
\smallskip
\item Start from MFN rates in 2017, measure tariff changes onward.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
My measure of tariff exposure at the county level:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\tau_{c,t}^{i} = \sum_{s\in S}\frac{L_{c,s,2017}}{L_{c, S, 2017}} \  \tau_{s,t}^{i} ,
\end{eqnarray*}\\
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item $\frac{L_{c,s,2017}}{L_{c, S, 2017}}  = $ 2017 share of county $c$'s employment in industry $s$.
\smallskip
\item $\tau_{s,t}^{i}$ is the implemented tariff by country $i$, industry $s$, date $t$.
\smallskip
\item Idea: if a county's employment is all in soybeans, then the county is protected and/or faces the soybean tariff.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Final point: Most my focus is on the Chinese retaliation... will show some stuff about US side.

\begin{frame}[t]{My Consumption Measure: New Auto Sales}
From IHS Polk. Counts of new auto sales (not values).
\begin{itemize}
\item At the county level (by local of registration, not sale),
\smallskip
\item Monthly from January 2016 to December 2021.
\smallskip
\item By make (e.g. Ford) and model (F-150).
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Derived from registration data from State DMVs.\\
\bigskip
While just autos, a very compelling, high-quality measure\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item Essentially an ``administrative'' level dataset. In levels it matches NIPA very closely.
\smallskip
\item High-frequency, detailed geographic variation, near real time. Can't be matched by CEX or PSID.
\smallskip
\item Not subject to sampling or provider issues as in other propriety datasets (e.g Kilts-Nielsen, Credit/Debit card transactions data).

\begin{frame}[t]{Market Facilitation Payments (MFP)}
Trump Administration and USDA set up the \href{https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2018/08/30/2018-18842/market-facilitation-program}{Market Facilitation Program} to assist farmers ``directly impacted by unjustified foreign retaliatory tariffs'' (from the website).
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item 2018 program paid out direct \$\$\$  based upon crop harvested.
\smallskip
\item Trump Administration authorized up to \$12 billion USD; in my data \$8.6 billion was paid out.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
This is public record.\\
\smallskip
So I applied through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and asked for all payments, who received them, and the addresses to which the payments were made.
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item The address are a unique, novel part of my data.
\smallskip
\item I have a measure of the location of where the payment was received, not the location of production.

\textbf{Step 1}: Time aggregate levels at the bimonthly level. Then focus on year over year $\log$ differences.\\

\textbf{Step 2}: Explore different permutations of the following specification:
\begin{eqnarray*}
\Delta \log Y_{c,t} \ = \ \sum_{i\in \{ch, us\}}\beta_{i} \Delta \log(1 + \tau^{i}_{c,t}) + \sum_{y = B1, 2017}^{B2, 2019}\left( \mathrm{1} \left\{t = y \right\}
X^{'}_{c}\delta_y \right) + X^{'}_{c,t}\lambda + \alpha_t + \alpha_0 +  \epsilon_{c,t}
\end{eqnarray*}
\begin{itemize}
\item $\beta_{i}$s are the coefficient of interest, answers how the change in the tariff affected employment and consumption.
\smallskip
\item $\delta_y$s are the coefficients on interactions of fixed, county-level characteristics with time. Hope is to control for (i) pre-trends and (ii) other $c\times t$ shocks during the treatment period.
\smallskip
\item $\lambda$ are coefficients on time varying county-level characteristics; mostly just receipt of Market Facilitation Program payments.

Why? Three issues:
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Standard problem that diff-in-diff evidence only about relative statements, not levels.
\smallskip
\item[2.] The welfare effects depend on changes in the broader basket of consumption not durables.
\smallskip
\item[2.] Evidence is suggestive of expectations mattering, i.e. reactions to news about future tariff actions.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
How?
\begin{itemize}
\item Heterogenous agent (i.e. Bewley-Huggett-Aiyagari) +  multi-region, multi-country trade model.
\smallskip
\item Calibrate to evidence above.

\item Simulate transition path to tariff shocks and news about them.

\textbf{Time:} Discrete time, infinite horizon.\\

\textbf{Geography and Trade:} Two regions in the US (\textcolor{red}{``red''} and \textcolor{blue}{``blue''}) and China. A location produces a differentiated commodity as in Armington and trade occurs subject to trade costs and tariffs.\\

\textbf{Households:} They live and work in a region while facing idiosyncratic productivity shocks. They purchase and use the aggregated commodity to:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item eat it $c$,
\item transform it into a durable good $d$, i.e. a ``car''

\begin{frame}[t]{Model: Households and Preferences}
\medskip
Mass of $L_i$ households in each location $i$.\\
\medskip
Preferences:
\begin{align*}
\small
& E \sum_{t = 0}^{\infty} \beta^{t} u(c_{t},d_{t}, \ell_{t})\\
\\
\mbox{where}  \ \ \ & u(c,d,\ell) =  \log \left( c^{\alpha}d^{1-\alpha}  \right) + \nu \ell + \ \epsilon_{dj} + \ \epsilon_{hj} \label{eq:utility-nols}
\end{align*}
\medskip
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_{dj}$ are iid Type 1 EV shocks over option $j$ of buying a new car or sticking with old car.
\medskip
\item Leisure / work is a discrete choice too.\\
\smallskip
Either work or not $(\ell = 0 \ \mbox{or} \ \ell = 1)$ where $\epsilon_{hj}$ are iid Type 1 EV shocks over those options.

\begin{frame}[t]{Model: Cars}

The stock of durable consumption evolves according to:
\begin{align*}
&\mathtt{if} \ \mathtt{stay}, \ \ d_{t+1} = (1-\delta)d_{t}
\\
&\mathtt{if} \ \mathtt{buy \ new}, \ \ d_{t+1} = d(n).
\end{align*}\\
\medskip
Expenditures on durables takes the following form:
\begin{align*}
& \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mathtt{if} \ \mathtt{stay}, \ \  e_{t} = 0
\\
& \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \mathtt{if} \ \mathtt{buy \ new}, \ \ e_{t} = p_{n}d(n) - p_{u}d_{t}.
\end{align*}
\begin{itemize}
\item $d(n)$ is quality units of a new car. This is normalized, it's not a choice variable.
\smallskip
\item $d_{t}$ is quality units of a used car; $\delta$ is the depreciation rate.
\smallskip
\item $p_{n}$ is the rate of transformation to convert one unit of non-durable consumption into a \textbf{new} car.
\smallskip
\item $p_{u}$ is the rate of transformation for used/depreciated cars.
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]{Model: Work, Assets, and Tariff Revenue}
\medskip
A household's efficiency units $z_t$ evolve according to a discrete state Markov chain. They face the wage per efficiency unit $w_{i,t}$.\\
\bigskip
Households borrow or accumulate a non-state contingent asset, $a$, with gross return $R$ which pays out in units of the final good. Household's face the debt limit
\begin{align*}
a_{t+1} \ \geq \ -\phi.
\end{align*}\\

Tariff revenue $\tau_{r}$ is lump sum rebated to households. \\
\bigskip
Putting this all together, a household's budget constraint is
\begin{align*}
w_{i,t} z_{t} (1 - \ell)  + P_{i,t} R a_{t} + P_{i,t} \tau_{r,i,t} \  \geq \ P_{i,t} a_{t+1} + P_{i,t} c_{t} + P_{i,t} e_{t}.
\end{align*}
where $P_{i,t}$ is the price index of the final good (next slide) in location $i$.
\end{frame}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}[t]{Model: Production and Trade}
\medskip
The final good is:
\begin{align*}
Q = \bigg \{ \sum_{k}^{M}  q_{k}^{\frac{\theta - 1}{\theta}} \bigg \}^{\frac{\theta}{\theta - 1}},
\end{align*}
where each location $k$ produces it's nationally differentiated commodity with production technology
\begin{align*}
q_k = A_k N_k,
\end{align*}
where $N_k$ are the efficiency units of labor supplied by households.\\
\bigskip
Trade faces several obstacles:
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item iceberg trade costs $d_{nk}$ for a good to go from supplier $k$ to buyer $n$,
\smallskip
\item tariffs on goods that cross borders $\tau_{nk}$ which is the tariff that country $n$ imposes on the commodity that county $k$ produces.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
And associated with this environment is the price index $P_{i,t}$ seen in the last slide.

\medskip
The basic idea\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item[1.] Households' consumption, durables, savings, and work decisions determine goods demand and labor supply.
\smallskip
\item[2.] Trade determines goods supply and labor demand.
\end{itemize}
\medskip
Need \textbf{1.} and \textbf{2.} to be consistent.\\
\bigskip
\medskip
One detail. The asset market. Today, I'm not going to clear it (I ran out of time). In future, the plan is to explore
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item[1.] Financial autarky, so bond market clears domestically.
\smallskip
\item[2.] Financial integration, so bond market clears internationally.
\end{itemize}

Two regions in the US ({\color{red} red} and {\color{blue} blue}) and China.
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item No trade costs, no tariffs between US regions.
\smallskip
\item But external trade costs setup so the {\color{red} red} region exports more to China than {\color{blue} blue} region.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
Simulate the response of the economy to observed change in tariffs.
\begin{itemize}
\smallskip
\item Give households 3 periods of advance news, similar to what happened.
\smallskip
\item China targets {\color{red} red} region more than {\color{blue} blue} region.
\smallskip
\item Viewed as a permanent change (data seems to validate this!).

\frametitle{My Progress Report}
\textbf{What I've done:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measured tariff-induced changes in consumption at a narrow geographic level: auto sales growth fell by $\approx$ 4 p.p. in high-tariff counties relative to low-tariff counties.
\smallskip
\item Evidence that the fall in consumption relates to a reduction in production and labor market opportunities for those most exposed.
\smallskip
\item As of now, all this is $\approx$ consistent with what comes out of a forward-looking/ dynamic heterogenous agent +  multi-region, multi-country trade model.
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
\textbf{I'm working on now!}
\begin{itemize}
\item A real calibration/ estimation of model and welfare analysis. Improved treatment of asset market. Talk to me in a month.
\smallskip
\item My RA Thomas Hasenzagl and I are piecing together a public GITHUB repository with code to implement Heterogenous Agent Trade (HAT) models, fast and efficiently.
